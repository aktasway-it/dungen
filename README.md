# DunGen - A simple dungeon generator for Unity

This is a simple project I made in my spare time to implement some basic dungeon generator based on A* pathfinding algorithm.

There is also a simple module included for rendering the dungeon in 2D a basic player controller to move inside the grid.

Nothing too fancy, but can be inspiring for those looking into random procedural dungeon generation. :)
